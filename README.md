# RoboBomb

Strategic Destruction: Use z to plant bombs strategically to obliterate your foes and clear paths, but beware! The ground itself is fragile. A misplaced explosion could leave you plummeting into the abyss.

Utilize double jumps for increased mobility and sprint to swiftly evade enemy attacks and navigate the treacherous terrain.

Time is Ticking:

Collapse Timer: This timer dictates how long the level remains stable. As the timer counts down, the ground becomes increasingly unstable, with sections collapsing and creating hazardous gaps.
Win Timer: This timer appears when there are no  enemies. Once the Win Timer reaches zero, you successfully complete the level without further challenge.
